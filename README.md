This project will be building a website of food recipes that will have a description of said food, a list of ingredients needed to make food, the steps to make the food, and links to more recipes of other foods.
I should be able to demonstrate the skills I learned with HTML with this project such as creating the boilerplate of html, bolding and italizing words, creating links, and adding images to the website.
